# Freecodecamp Projects

## About this Repo
Welcome to my repository for freeCodeCamp developer certification projects. In 2021, I earned the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Developer Certificates.  You can view my original project submissions on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/christadejesus), but I wanted to create a space to hold them here as well.

You are welcome to view the code, play around with the code, fix the code (this is code from my newbie days, afterall!), and find inspiration in the code for your own projects. Just please remember not to copy the code to claim as your own. If there's one thing I've learned on this journey it's that the only way to solidify what you're learning and truly grow as a developer is to build your own projects...and build a lot of them! 

Happy hacking and good luck on your journey!
