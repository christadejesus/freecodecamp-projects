# Freecodecamp Projects

## About this Repo

Welcome to my repository for freecodecamp developer certification projects!

I received my first two certifications in 2021 and currently working on my third, Front End Development Libraries. As I started in on this third set of projects, I wanted to create a space to hold all of the certification projects I had work so hard on. Unfortunately, I've lost some of the originals along the way, but have created new versions to have for my reference and yours!

My hope is that these projects will help another future developer on their journey. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I know how challenging the self-study journey can be when you're flying solo, so I'm happy to help you where I can!

## Notes:

1. This repo only holds the HTML/CSS/JS projects from the Responsive Web Design and JavaScript courses. You can find these and other freecodecamp projects here:
