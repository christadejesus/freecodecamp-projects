                        meaning or not, but at the very least, it is clear that we humans who live on this earth face
                        the
                        task of making a happy life for ourselves.</p>

                    <p>We must take into consideration even the slightest positive aspect of our lives. For if we fail
                        to
                        find some way of uplifting ourselves, there is every danger of sinking further into our sense of
                        powerlessness. This can lead us to believe that we have no capacity for doing good whatsoever.
                        Thus
                        we create the conditions of despair itself.</p>
